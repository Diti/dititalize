One of my persistent wants is to “digitalize” my life and my home.
When it comes to house management and monitoring, I have a few projets in mind.

* An inventory of house items (with their invoices, warranties, manuals).
* A smart house dashboard relying on https://mqtt.org/[MQTT messaging] between devices.

== Smart house, powered by https://elixir-lang.org/[Elixir]

What I imagine my _augmented_ daily routine to be:

[source#example-id,elixir]
----
defmodule Test do
  def hello do # <1>
    IO.puts(:stderr, "Hello world")
  end
end
----
<1> Can be called with `Test.hello`

Hehe
