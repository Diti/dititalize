One of my persistent wants is to “digitalize” my life and my home.
When it comes to house management and monitoring, I have a few projets in mind.

* An inventory of house items (with their invoices, warranties, manuals).
* A smart house dashboard relying on https://mqtt.org/[MQTT messaging] between devices.
